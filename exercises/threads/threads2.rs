// Building on the last exercise, we want all of the threads to complete their

//The lock() method is a part of the Mutex struct in Rust's standard library (std::sync::Mutex). A mutex stands for "mutual exclusion" and is a concurrency primitive used to protect shared data from being concurrently accessed by multiple threads.

// The lock() method is used to acquire a lock on the Mutex. When a thread calls lock(), if the mutex is currently not locked by any thread, the calling thread locks the mutex and continues execution. If the mutex is already locked, the calling thread will be blocked until the mutex is unlocked doc.rust-lang.org.
